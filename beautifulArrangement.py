# Time Complexity : O(p), where p is the number of valid permutations, worst case O(n!) if all valid.
# Space Complexity : O(n), array space, where n is the given input N
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : no

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach

# The approach keeps track of the valid permutations using a Boolean array, where
# the index represent a number. For every index, a valid permutation is formed on
# the basis of the rules provided. If the permutation is formed, the result is incremented.
